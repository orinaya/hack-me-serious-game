      <h2>Your Data is Ours Now</h2>
      <p>
        By playing *Hack.Me*, you agree to surrender all personal data, including but not limited to
        your middle school email address, any cringy usernames you've ever used, and your Netflix
        “continue watching” list (yes, we saw that unfinished anime). We won’t sell this data. We’ll
        just judge you for it.
      </p>

      <h3>The Mandatory VPN Clause</h3>
      <p>
        If you’re not using a VPN while playing this game, you must yell “I LOVE AD TRACKERS” at
        least once per turn. Refusal to comply means you automatically lose, and we reserve the
        right to sign you up for five random mailing lists.
      </p>

      <h3>Unauthorized Dice Rolls</h3>
      <p>
        Any unauthorized dice rolls will be treated as an act of treason against the mainframe. Your
        Specialist card will immediately be replaced with a “404 Error” card, which does nothing but
        sit there and mock you.
      </p>

      <h3>The NFT Ban</h3>
      <p>
        If anyone at the table mentions NFTs, all players must collectively point at them and chant,
        “This is why we can’t have nice things.” The offending player must then discard their entire
        hand and draw five “Clown” cards, which only say “Honk honk” on them.
      </p>

      <h3>The "I Know a Guy" Rule</h3>
      <p>
        Any player who claims to “know a guy in cybersecurity” must provide a verified LinkedIn
        connection within five minutes or lose three action points. No one cares about your cousin’s
        IT job at Best Buy, Kevin.
      </p>

      <h3>Password Amnesia</h3>
      <p>
        If you forget the rules mid-game and ask, “Wait, how do I attack again?” you must spend your
        next turn writing a heartfelt apology to your team in Comic Sans, explaining why you were
        unprepared for this *very serious* tabletop experience.
      </p>

      <h3>The Buffering Penalty</h3>
      <p>
        Anytime a player takes longer than 10 seconds to decide their move, they are considered
        “buffering” and must audibly hum elevator music until their turn ends. Bonus points if it’s
        off-key.
      </p>

      <h3>The “Too Real” Clause</h3>
      <p>
        Any player who says, “Wow, this is just like my job” is immediately banned from playing for
        the next three rounds. We play games to escape reality, not to be reminded of the three
        security tickets you left unresolved yesterday.
      </p>

      <h3>Critical Update Required</h3>
      <p>
        Once per game, a random player must announce a "critical system update" and make everyone
        pause for 60 seconds while they pretend to reboot. This adds nothing to the game but feels
        oddly authentic, so we’re keeping it.
      </p>

      <h3>The Ultimate Endgame</h3>
      <p>
        If a player wins by cracking all passwords, they are immediately promoted to "CEO of Cyber"
        and must spend the next 24 hours referring to themselves as such in all texts and emails. No
        exceptions.
